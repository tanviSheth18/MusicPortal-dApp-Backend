# Messaging Decentralized Application

One of the coolest things about Web3 is the way it opens up so many possibilities for innovation and creativity. It has the potential to completely democratize the web and allow a much more diverse range of people and organizations to participate in creating and shaping the online world, something our lives now revolve around.

Check out my first deployment of a full-stack decentralized application and Ethereum Smart Contract! This basic application lets you connect your Ethereum wallet to wave at me or contribute to the 'global music favorites playlist' for a chance to be rewarded ETH!

My project lets users experience the diversity of our worldâ€™s rich culture through music, this powerful element that everyone around the globe holds so much value and respect for. My technical growth was exponential as I built this project, but I also hope that my application will introduce users to new music that they can be impacted by and gain a deeper appreciation for.
